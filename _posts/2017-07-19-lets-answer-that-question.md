## My first post, and an answer to a question.

I've been working on this GitHub repository for only a short time. Honestly I wasn't intending on adding blog posts here for a while. Mainly I've been working on a new CV/Resume section to come soon, and on files to push to my second repo. This really needed a response though. Since I have no character limit here, why not push it to my site?
Below is my response to a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6293101016833417217"><b>post</b></a> by Alan Smithson, CEO of <a href="http://metavrse.com/"><b>MetaVRse</b></a>.

To quote Alan he asked -

Here we go, I have a few...

Possibly go to a coding school or back to college to pick up a few new skills. But while I was doing that –

* Pay off any debt I had at that point, get a smallish place with an office, and access to a gym. Then prepare to work the list below.
* Establish 3 endowment funds, initially focus on growth and long-term investment stability.
* Once the 3 funds were at a sufficient level and sustainable, set up three non-profits. All would likely focus on one state/province initially before I eventually took them national.
* The first non-profit group would be focused on providing STEM and art education opportunities in rural areas, as well as providing incentive to certain community colleges to provide certain programs. Possibly even set up coding schools.
* The second non-profit would coordinate between rural business hubs, chambers of commerce and business accelerators in certain areas. Especially those designated as federal HUBZones or similar. Basically, this group would act a catalyst to accelerate STEM and art related business opportunities in rural areas. Giving those going through programs provided by the first non-profit opportunities to stay in the area via getting jobs or starting their own businesses.
* The third would be focused on a cause – diagnosis, outreach and assistance to children and adults on the autism spectrum in those same rural areas. Give more children the opportunity to develop soft and hard skills to function in a society of neurotypicals. Then get them access to programs offered by the first two non-profit groups. For adults who are or may be on the spectrum, provide access to diagnostic, therapeutic, and other services. Most medical insurance doesn’t cover adult diagnosis or other services for autism. This mission is one area I think certain technologies such as VR/AR may be helpful in.
* Finally, I would build my own solution for hyper-localized cloud and Metro Area Network services in rural areas. Currently it exists in notebooks. I call it Aurora. Some other product probably uses a similar name, so I may need to change it later. For now, Aurora is the name I’m sticking with.

You probably see the theme here. Though I live in Southern California, I grew up in a small city, surrounded by small towns. I find it crazy that I am trained and have experience in skills where opportunity to use them to work a job or business practically doesn’t exist back home. Worse, where there is practically no opportunity for others to establish or grow in such an industry in the area without investment that will never come. Every year, high school graduates leave the area for college or the military and don’t come back. **Ever.** Because of lack of opportunity.

Occasionally I’ll spend a few bucks on a lottery ticket when the jackpot hit $200M or so. Even though I know the odds are better that I’ll be struck by lightning a dozen times in the same spot on the beach. Most people do this for the usual reasons – pay off bills, buy a house, get a crazy car, party like it’s a year in the last 50 ending in 9. I buy that ticket because I have some extremely ambitious goals. Goals some of which collectively would likely take a decade of hard work to accomplish. Work that can’t begin without cold, hard cash. Until then I keep working on my day job, and the skill sets I eventually need to make some changes.

The question is not whether my goals are massive enough. It’s whether they’re too massive for everyone else.
