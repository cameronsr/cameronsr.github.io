## About me

I'm <b>Sean Cameron</b>, a Technologist specializing in Network Engineering & Product Management.
My professional interests include Information Systems, Biotechnology, and Data Science. In some of my spare moments I also study Python, Ruby, and other programming languages.
You can contact me by email or LinkedIn, and see my GitHub profile via buttons at the main page. You can also access these from the About drop down to your upper left.
This site is a work in progress, and will receive occasional updates in between other projects. Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day.

### New features
- Via the About drop down, you can now see my Artstation page. At a future date I'll be adding an action button on the Home page to do the same.
- There is now also a Weather page. Currently it hosts an `iframe` widget feeding local data from NASA/JPL's Insight Lander on Mars. My next project for that page will be to host a local weather & time widget that I'll code myself.

### Future features
Keep an eye on this site for features coming at a future time.
- A Resources page(s) with links to courses, sites or GitHub repos of interest depending on subject. Initially, I will be posting links to data science related resources.
- An Events page showing links to events I'm hosting on Meetup, or other local events you may be interested in.

## About the site

### Background Art

The current background art is a piece called, 'Long Arm of the Galaxy'. It is used in a custom desktop theme. If you're interested in the art, you can find the original at **[Imgur](https://imgur.com/y8PRWgs)**.
If you want to know more about the custom desktop that uses this art, you can find the article over at **[Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/the-long-arm-of-the-galaxy-desktop-1733871000)**.
Note that I could not find the submitter to attribute this background to. If you are the original submitter on Imgur or know who is, please contact me so I can give proper credit on the site.

### Moon Jekyll Theme

This site is published from a GitHub repository that is set up as an orphan fork of **[Moon](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)**, a minimal, one column Jekyll theme.
In addition to hosting a personal site with this repo, I am also using it as a sandbox to experiment with different ideas.
If you want to try this theme without any of my additions, go to the original source and fork from there. More information on the theme is below.

### Features
* Minimal, you can focus on your content
